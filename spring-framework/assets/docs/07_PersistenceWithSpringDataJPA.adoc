= Persistence with Spring Data JPA and Hibernate

Understanding how to use Hibernate and Spring Data JPA.

== Persistence with Spring Data JPA - Configuration

This example demonstrates persistence with Hibernate and Spring Data JPA

. Dependencies +
⇒ link:../../ch07_spring-data-jpa/pom.xml[pom.xml] +
There are new dependencies introduced. Look for `spring-data-jpa` in the `pom.xml`.

. *Config* - the class that specifies the component scanning instruction. +
⇒ link:../../ch06_spring-jpa/src/main/java/bnymellon/training/spring/framework/config/ColoredShapeConfig.java[ColoredShapeConfig.java] +
The config class is supplied. This config class specifies the packages to be scanned for components. +
⇒ link:../../ch06_spring-jpa/src/main/java/bnymellon/training/spring/framework/config/HibernateJPAConfig.java[HibernateJPAConfig.java] +
The class that configures the HibernateEntityManager to connect to a database.

. *Controller* layer +
⇒ link:../../ch07_spring-data-jpa/src/main/java/bnymellon/training/spring/framework/controller/ColoredShapeControllingBean.java[ColoredShapeControllingBean.java] +
The class auto-wires a `ColoredShapeService` interface, the Spring context has a
`ColoredShapeServiceImpl` that will be used as an auto-wired instance (remember the *Liskov
Substitution Principle*). The controller invokes the service methods to persist and retrieve
ColoredShape instances. The class is marked with a `@Component` annotation.

. *Service* layer +
⇒ link:../../ch07_spring-data-jpa/src/main/java/bnymellon/training/spring/framework/service/ColoredShapeServiceImpl.java[ColoredShapeServiceImpl.java] +
The class is marked with a `@Service` annotation. The `@Service` is an alias for the `@Component`
annotation (see the code). It should display a `@AliasFor(annotation = Component.class)`. The
service implementation auto-wires a `ColoredShapeDao` interface and will access the
`ColoredShapeDaoImpl` via the spring context. Methods in the service delegate to methods in the
DAO.

. *DAO* layer +
⇒ link:../../ch07_spring-data-jpa/src/main/java/bnymellon/training/spring/framework/dao/ColoredShapeDao.java[ColoredShapeDao.java] +
Notice the *_magic_* that no implementation was coded. Spring Data JPA _"figures out"_ the
implementations from the method signature. The method signatures can get complex with *AND* and
*OR* clauses. For instance, a valid method: `findOneByColorOrShape(String color, String shape)`.

A new dependency spring-data-jpa is added. A Java configuration is used to setup the embedded
database (XML could have been used as well).

The *service* layer invokes the *DAO* layer. The *DAO* layer _is simply an interface_ that
extends the `CrudRepository` from *spring-data-jpa*. `CrudRepository` provides basic method
signatures for CRUD operations on a given entity.
