= Inversion of Control in Spring
:toc:

== Spring - Inversion of Control

Understanding how Spring "loads" its "beans".

As mentioned in the introduction, *Inversion of Control* and *Dependency Injection* bring about a
flexibility to programming.

Let us walk through a few examples that show how *Inversion of Control* is possible with Spring.

== Java Example without Spring

1. We use a model +
⇒ link:../../ch01_spring-inversion-of-control/src/main/java/bnymellon/training/spring/framework/model/ColoredShape.java[ColoredShape.java].

2. A plain Java example with no spring used +
⇒ link:../../ch01_spring-inversion-of-control/src/main/java/bnymellon/training/spring/framework/Ex00_NoFrameworkExample.java[Ex00_NoFrameworkExample.java].

3. In order to produce a different color and shape, *_either_*, the command line arguments *_or_*, the java code needs to be manipulated.

.Output
****
 Running the main method should output
 > pink polygon
 created with default values on ColoredShape which itself is instantiated with a default constructor.
****

.Questions
****
  1. What if the requirement was to produce two shapes: a pink and a cyan triangle?
  2. What if the requirement was to include a blue square in addition?

== Using Spring to achieve Inversion of Control (IoC)

=== Example 1 - Using Spring with Constructor Instantiation

1. For the model, we have two model objects to look at +
⇒ link:../../ch01_spring-inversion-of-control/src/main/java/bnymellon/training/spring/framework/model/ColoredShape.java[ColoredShape.java]

2. Here is an example of using Spring with a constructor instantiating the value +
⇒ link:../../ch01_spring-inversion-of-control/src/main/java/bnymellon/training/spring/framework/Ex01_InstantiationThroughConstructor.java[Ex01_InstantiationThroughConstructor.java] +
This class has a `ClassPathXmlApplicationContext` which reads the XML configuration. The
`ApplicationContext` is the Spring Inversion of Control. The `main` method transfers control of
loading beans to the `ClassPathXmlApplicationContext`, which then loads _beans_ from the XML file.

3. Here is the XML configuration for this Spring class +
⇒ link:../../ch01_spring-inversion-of-control/src/main/resources/ex01-instantiation-through-constructor.xml[ex01-instantiation-through-constructor.xml].

4. Notice how the default constructor from `ColoredShape` is used to configure the properties.

.Output
****
 Running the main method should output
 > green circle
 created with default values on ColoredShape which itself is instantiated with a default constructor.
****

=== Example 2 - Using Spring with Static Factory Instantiation

1. Here is an example of using Spring with a static factory instantiating the value +
⇒ link:../../ch01_spring-inversion-of-control/src/main/java/bnymellon/training/spring/framework/Ex02_InstantiationThroughStaticFactory.java[Ex02_InstantiationThroughStaticFactory]. +
A static method, `getInstance()` is a supplier of a `ColoredShape` instance.

2. Here is the configuration for this Spring class +
⇒ link:../../ch01_spring-inversion-of-control/src/main/resources/ex02-instantiation-through-static-factory.xml[ex02-instantiation-through-static-factory.xml]. +
The `bean` is declared with a `factory-method`, which points to the `getInstance()` method.

3. Notice how the static factory method from `Ex02_InstantiationThroughStaticFactory` is used to
configure the properties.

.Output
****
 Running the main method should output
 > harlequin hexagon
 created due to the invocation of the static factory method on Ex02_InstantiationThroughStaticFactory
****

'''

=== Example 3 - Using Spring with Instance Factory Instantiation

1. Here is an example of using Spring with an instance factory instantiating the value +
⇒ link:../../ch01_spring-inversion-of-control/src/main/java/bnymellon/training/spring/framework/Ex03_InstantiationThroughInstanceFactory.java[Ex03_InstantiationThroughInstanceFactory.java]. +
An instance method `getInstance()` is a supplier of the `ColoredShape` instance. The `constructor`
is first called to create the class, the `ClassPathXmlApplicationContext` then parses the XML to
configure the _bean_.

2. Here is the configuration for this Spring class +
⇒ link:../../ch01_spring-inversion-of-control/src/main/resources/ex03-instantiation-through-instance-factory.xml[ex03-instantiation-through-instance-factory.xml]. +
The `bean` is declared with a `factory-bean` which determines that there is a `bean` that has an
instance `factory-method`.

3. Notice how the instance factory method from `Ex03_InstantiationThroughInstanceFactory` is used
to configure the properties. The `Ex03_InstantiationThroughInstanceFactory` class is first
constructed via a default constructor, then the instance factory method is invoked to configure
the bean. A simple System.out.println() was added to show the loading of the class.

.Output
****
 This should output two lines:
 > Ex03_InstantiationThroughInstanceFactory is now loaded.
 > red rhombus
 created due to the instantiation and invocation of the instance method on Ex03_InstantiationThroughInstanceFactory

== Exercise Lab

The lab exercise is to fix the broken tests. Follow the instructions to fix the TODOs to get the
JUnit test to pass.
