= Persistence with Spring with Hibernate
:toc:
:toclevels: 4

Understanding how to use Hibernate for persistence in Spring.

== Spring + Hibernate persistence - Overview
Only one sample discussed.

TIP: This section focuses on package naming and standards as well.

IMPORTANT: System.out.println(...) calls are replaced with a LOGGER instance.

Recommended packaging call hierarchy (the package layers as called from any code using the
application): (controller → service →  dao) + model  + config is covered.

An embedded database is used, in lieu of an actual external database.

=== Output - Standards
. Usage of `System.out.println(...)` is generally a bad idea. Not all applications run on servers
that can be accessed while the application is running. Additionally, there may be a need to output
to more than one location such as a database, email, file, message bus etc. Hence, the
`System.out.println(...)` calls are replaced with LOGGER usage.

== Introduction to Hibernate
Covering a full course on Hibernate is definitely out of scope of this tutorial. A brief set of
notes on Hibernate: +

- Hibernate ORM (Object Relational Mapping) is an object-relational mapping tool for the Java
programming language.

- Hibernate's works by mapping Java classes to database tables and mapping from Java data types
to SQL data types.

- Hibernate ORM (Hibernate in short) works by mapping domain model objects with an annotation of
`@Entity`. The domain model maps to a table with the annotation of `@Table`.

- Hibernate also provides data query and retrieval facilities by generating SQL calls.

- Mapping of Java classes to database tables is implemented by the configuration of an *XML file*
or by using *Java Annotations*.

- Hibernate provides a `SessionFactory` to manage database sessions and transactions.

- Hibernate provides an `EntityManagerFactory` to manage database sessions and transactions using
the Java Persistence API standard.

This chapter demonstrates using Hibernate-proprietary `SessionFactory` to persist to and
retrieve from an embedded database.

=== Persistence with Hibernate - Configuration
This example demonstrates persistence with Hibernate.

. Hibernate dependencies +
⇒ link:../../ch05_spring-hibernate/pom.xml[pom.xml] +
 Look for `spring-jdbc`, `spring-orm` and `hibernate-core`. The embedded database is `h2`.

. Embedded H2 Database +
⇒ link:../../ch05_spring-hibernate/src/main/java/bnymellon/training/spring/framework/config/HibernateSessionConfig.java[HibernateSessionConfig.java] +
Check the `getDataSource()` method.

. External properties configuration +
⇒ link:../../ch05_spring-hibernate/src/main/java/bnymellon/training/spring/framework/config/HibernateSessionConfig.java[HibernateSessionConfig.java] +
Check the `@PropertySource` above the class name.

. External properties +
⇒ link:../../ch05_spring-hibernate/src/main/resources/application.properties[application.properties]

. Loading external properties +
⇒ link:../../ch05_spring-hibernate/src/main/java/bnymellon/training/spring/framework/config/HibernateSessionConfig.java[HibernateSessionConfig.java] +
Check the `getHibernateProperties()` method.

. Transaction manager +
⇒ link:../../ch05_spring-hibernate/src/main/java/bnymellon/training/spring/framework/config/HibernateSessionConfig.java[HibernateSessionConfig.java] +
Check the `getSessionFactory()` method.

. Component scan +
⇒ link:../../ch05_spring-hibernate/src/main/java/bnymellon/training/spring/framework/config/ColoredShapeConfig.java[ColoredShapeConfig.java] +
The class is declared as `@Configuration` and specifies a `@ComponentScan` instruction against the
base package.

Two new dependencies `spring-orm` and `hibernate-core` are added. A Java configuration is used to
setup the embedded database (XML could have been used as well).

Hibernate is configured with external properties via a `@PropertySource`, pointing to an
`application.properties`.

In addition to the embedded database and Hibernate configuration, a `LocalSessionFactoryBean` is
configured to manage persistence for Hibernate via auto-wiring.

A `TransactionManager` is also created for saves and updates. This provides for a means to commit
changes.

=== Persistence with Hibernate - Invocation

This example demonstrates persistence with Hibernate.

. *Application* - the executable to launch +
⇒ link:../../ch05_spring-hibernate/src/main/java/bnymellon/training/spring/framework/ColoredShapeApplication.java[ColoredShapeApplication.java] +
The example class loads the Spring context via an `AnnotationConfigApplicationContext`.

. *Config* layer - the configuration layer +
⇒ link:../../ch05_spring-hibernate/src/main/java/bnymellon/training/spring/framework/config/ColoredShapeConfig.java[ColoredShapeConfig.java] +
The config class is supplied. This config class specifies the packages to be scanned for components. +
⇒ link:../../ch05_spring-hibernate/src/main/java/bnymellon/training/spring/framework/config/HibernateSessionConfig.java[HibernateSessionConfig.java] +
The class sets up the Hibernate Session Factory bean to create a connection to the database.

. *Controller* layer +
⇒ link:../../ch05_spring-hibernate/src/main/java/bnymellon/training/spring/framework/controller/ColoredShapeControllingBean.java[ColoredShapeControllingBean.java] +
The class auto-wires a `ColoredShapeService` interface, the Spring context has a
`ColoredShapeServiceImpl` that will be used as an auto-wired instance (remember the *Liskov
Substitution Principle*). The controller invokes the service methods to persist and retrieve
ColoredShape instances. The class is marked with a `@Component` annotation.

. *Service* layer +
⇒ link:../../ch05_spring-hibernate/src/main/java/bnymellon/training/spring/framework/service/ColoredShapeServiceImpl.java[ColoredShapeServiceImpl.java] +
The class is marked with a `@Service` annotation. The `@Service` is an alias for the `@Component`
annotation (see the code). It should display a `@AliasFor(annotation = Component.class)`. The
service implementation auto-wires a `ColoredShapeDao` interface and will access the
`ColoredShapeDaoImpl` via the spring context. Methods in the service delegate to methods in the DAO.

. *DAO* layer +
⇒ link:../../ch05_spring-hibernate/src/main/java/bnymellon/training/spring/framework/dao/ColoredShapeDaoImpl.java[ColoredShapeDaoImpl.java] +
The class is marked with a `@Repository` annotation. The `@Repository` annotation is an alias for
the `@Component` annotation. It too should have a `@AliasFor(annotation = Component.class)`. The
DAO implementation uses an instance of the `SessionFactory` to communicate with the database.
Similar to the service, the DAO interface is wired with an implementation via the Spring context.

. *Model* layer +
⇒ link:../../ch05_spring-hibernate/src/main/java/bnymellon/training/spring/framework/model/ColoredShape.java[ColoredShape.java] +
This is the model for ColoredShape. The `id` attribute maps to a *primary key* in the *database
table*.

The application `ColoredShapeApplication` gets the bean for the *controller*
`ColoredShapeControllingBean`. The controller creates two new shapes, adds and lists them.
Additionally, the controller bean also updates one of the beans.

Each activity in the controller bean invokes the *service* layer. The service layer is used to
aggregate calls from/to the database to produce java objects, that match the expected output.
Since the example does not include complex objects, the service layer appears to be a pass
through layer to the DAO.

The *service* layer invokes the *DAO* layer. The *DAO* layer wires in a `SessionFactory`, that is
loaded by Spring as a part of its finding a Hibernate core dependency.

The transaction management is performed via the annotation `@Transactional` on the class or method.
The DAO is declared as _read-only_ at the class level (`@Transactional(readOnly = true)`) by
default  and as _read-write with propagation_ (`@Transactional(readOnly = false, propagation =
Propagation.REQUIRES_NEW)`) for the `save` method.

The model is marked as an `@Entity` and maps to a `@Table(name = "COLORED_SHAPE")`.
