= Persistence with Spring with Hibernate and JPA

Understanding how to use Hibernate and Spring with Java Persistence API.

== Spring persistence with Hibernate JPA - Configuration

This example demonstrates persistence with Hibernate.

. Hibernate dependencies +
⇒ link:../../ch06_spring-jpa/pom.xml[pom.xml] +
Look for `spring-jdbc`, `spring-orm`, `hibernate-core` and `hibernate-entitymanager` dependencies.

. Application +
⇒ link:../../ch06_spring-jpa/src/main/java/bnymellon/training/spring/framework/ColoredShapeApplication.java[ColoredShapeApplication.java] +
The class loads a Spring context through an `AnnotationConfigApplicationContext`.

. *Config* - the class that specifies the component scanning instruction.
⇒ link:../../ch06_spring-jpa/src/main/java/bnymellon/training/spring/framework/config/ColoredShapeConfig.java[ColoredShapeConfig.java] +
The config class is supplied. This config class specifies the packages to be scanned for components.
⇒ link:../../ch06_spring-jpa/src/main/java/bnymellon/training/spring/framework/config/HibernateJPAConfig.java[HibernateJPAConfig.java] +
The class that configures the HibernateEntityManager to connect to a database.

. *Controller* layer +
⇒ link:../../ch06_spring-jpa/src/main/java/bnymellon/training/spring/framework/controller/ColoredShapeControllingBean.java[ColoredShapeControllingBean.java] +
The class auto-wires a `ColoredShapeService` interface, the Spring context has a
`ColoredShapeServiceImpl` that will be used as an auto-wired instance (remember the *Liskov
Substitution Principle*). The controller invokes the service methods to persist and retrieve
ColoredShape instances. The class is marked with a `@Component` annotation.

. *Service* layer +
⇒ link:../../ch06_spring-jpa/src/main/java/bnymellon/training/spring/framework/service/ColoredShapeServiceImpl.java[ColoredShapeServiceImpl.java] +
The class is marked with a `@Service` annotation. The `@Service` is an alias for the
`@Component`annotation (see the code). It should display a
`@AliasFor(annotation = Component.class)`. The service implementation auto-wires a
`ColoredShapeDao` interface and will access the `ColoredShapeDaoImpl` via the spring context.
Methods in the service delegate to methods in the DAO.

. *DAO* layer +
⇒ link:../../ch06_spring-jpa/src/main/java/bnymellon/training/spring/framework/dao/ColoredShapeDaoImpl.java[ColoredShapeDaoImpl.java] +
The class is marked with a `@Repository` annotation. The `@Repository` annotation is an alias for
the `@Component` annotation. It too should have a `@AliasFor(annotation = Component.class)`. The
DAO implementation uses an instance of the `SessionFactory` to communicate with the database.
Similar to the service, the DAO interface is wired with an implementation via the Spring context.

A new dependency `hibernate-entitymanager` is added. A Java configuration is used to setup the
embedded database (XML could have been used as well).

Hibernate itself, is configured with external properties via a `@PropertySource`, pointing to
an `application.properties`.

In addition to the embedded database and Hibernate configuration, a
`LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean` is configured to manage persistence for Hibernate.

The *service* layer invokes the *DAO* layer. The *DAO* layer declares an `EntityManager`, as
a `@PersistenceContext`.

The transaction management is performed via the annotation `@Transactional`. The DAO is declared
as _read-only_ as default for the entire class and as _read-write with propagation_ for the
`save` method.

- Why is one preferred over the other?
