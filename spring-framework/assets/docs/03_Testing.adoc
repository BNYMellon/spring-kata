= Testing with Spring

Understanding how to test spring beans.

== Why testing is so important
Unit tests have many advantages. Testing facilitates:

- validation of the component design in isolation, making it easier to debug when there's a problem.
- testing of functionality which is either not exposed or not easily accessible from the program's
external interfaces, for instance, error handling and functionality which has no UI.
- a cheap way to ensure no major existing functionality is broken across the system when a
cross-component change is made.
- a means for people unfamiliar with the code to verify their changes haven't broken anything.
Additionally, tests provide an easy way to start understanding the functionality.
- to automate what might otherwise be arduous manual testing.

== Spring - testing overview
We will cover testing with Spring as an embedded portion of every chapter. However, this chapter
is focused on understanding the core testing framework Spring provides.

Spring tests use annotations, and are similar to JUnit tests.

Spring provides a JUnit test runner, `@SpringRunner` or its legacy forerunner, `@SpringJUnit4ClassRunner`.

Each Spring test can be launched with a JUnit runner hint on the test class:
[source,java]
----
@ExtendWith(SpringExtension.class)
----

Context for the test can be easily passed with an `@ContextConfiguration` which looks for a
bean definition context file *prefixed with the name of the class* the test resides in.

ContextConfiguration can also supply an argument to list one or more java classes that are
annotated with a `@Configuration`.

Spring testing relies heavily on the *Liskov Substitution Principle*. Thus, all Spring layers
are typically coded as an interface plus its implementation. Testing with such an approach allows
for replacing the implementation with a fake (mock) one that implements the higher interface.

=== Testing with default XML context configuration

This example demonstrates using a *default XML context* for testing code. This uses the name of
the test class with a suffix of `-context.xml` under the resources.

1. The JUnit test +
⇒ link:../../ch03_spring-testing/src/test/java/bnymellon/training/spring/framework/Ex01_DefaultXMLContextConfiguration.java[Ex01_DefaultXMLContextConfiguration.java] +
This class is a JUnit test marked with an annotation `@ContextConfiguration`. This annotation
hints at looking for an XML file with the same name (and under the same package), suffixed with
`-context.xml`. Thus running the class will cause Spring to search for a file named
`Ex01_DefaultXMLContextConfiguration-context.xml` on the classpath, and load beans from the XML file,
should it be located.

2. The XML file +
⇒ link:../../ch03_spring-testing/src/test/resources/bnymellon/training/spring/framework/Ex01_DefaultXMLContextConfiguration-context.xml[Ex01_DefaultXMLContextConfiguration-context.xml] +
The default context configuration file (same package, name matches the Java class and adds a `-context.xml`).

The `@ContextConfiguration` without any arguments will look for an XML file in the same package
which has a name, with the convention <JavaClassName>-context.xml. Notice the package location of
this XML matches the package location of the Java class as well, even though it is not under
src/test/java, but under src/test/resources.

This XML is auto-loaded and beans defined in this XML are available for autowiring.

'''

=== Testing with custom XML context configuration

This example demonstrates using a *custom XML context* for testing code. This uses the name of
the XML passed into as the location attribute.

1. The JUnit test +
⇒ link:../../ch03_spring-testing/src/test/java/bnymellon/training/spring/framework/Ex02_CustomXMLContextConfiguration.java[Ex02_CustomXMLContextConfiguration.java] +
This class is a JUnit test marked with an annotation `@ContextConfiguration`. This annotation now
includes a `locations` attribute, specifying the *XML file to load the context from*. Thus running
the class will cause Spring to search for the file on the classpath, and load beans from the XML
file, should it be located.

2. The XML file +
⇒ link:../../ch03_spring-testing/src/test/resources/ex02.xml[ex02.xml] +
The XML file can have any name and any location.

The `@ContextConfiguration` with the `locations` attribute looks for the XML file in the classpath
specified. Notice that the XML file no longer needs a naming convention and that the location of
this XML is not connected to the Java class location, it just needs to be on the classpath.

This XML is auto-loaded and beans defined in this XML are available for autowiring.

'''

=== Testing with Java context configuration

This example demonstrates using a Java configuration context for testing code. There is no XML file,
the context is loaded from a Java class marked with the `@Configuration` annotation.

1. The JUnit test +
⇒ link:../../ch03_spring-testing/src/test/java/bnymellon/training/spring/framework/Ex03_JavaContextConfiguration.java[Ex03_JavaContextConfiguration.java] +
This class is a JUnit test marked with an annotation `@ContextConfiguration`. This annotation
now includes a `classes` attribute, specifying the *class to load the context from*. Thus running
the class will cause Spring to search for the file on the classpath, and load beans from the XML
file, should it be located.

2. The Configuration class +
⇒ link:../../ch03_spring-testing/src/main/java/bnymellon/training/spring/framework/model/DIConfiguration.java[DIConfiguration.java] +
This class is located under the *main* module and is scanned during the launch of the test code,
and loads the beans defined in the class, into the context.

The `@ContextConfiguration` with the `classes` attribute looks for the Java configurations on the
classpath specified. Notice that the `DIConfiguration` is stereotyped as a `@Configuration` and it
also initiates a `@ComponentScan` for the basePackage of the *model*. The scan, while not
necessary here, is shown as a means to load other components for the test, if and when necessary.
The configuration provides two different `ColoredShapeHolder` instances, both of which can be
independently accessed in the test.

== Exercise Lab

The lab exercise is to fix the broken tests. Follow the instructions to fix the TODOs to get the
JUnit test to pass.
