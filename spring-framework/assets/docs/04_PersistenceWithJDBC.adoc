= Persistence with Spring

Understanding how to write into and read from a database using Spring.

== Spring Persistence - Overview

Spring provides many ways of persistence.

Covering all possibilities is outside the scope of this tutorial.

Some commonly used persistence mechanisms are explained in the next few chapters.

This chapter delves into the most basic persistence, to explain the fundamentals.

Note that the examples use an embedded database, which does not replace the need for an actual
external database in production applications. The logic, hoever, remain the same.

Similar to previous chapters two examples of a spring-configuration: XML and Java based are used.

== Spring Persistence - Examples
Both examples share some common features.

- Relies on an embedded database. An embedded database H2 is used an in-memory database.

- Any changes made during a run will be wiped out when the application terminates, since this is
an embedded database, scoped to the execution of the application.

=== Common steps
. Creating the database table and seeding it with values +
⇒ link:../../ch04_spring-persistence/src/main/resources/db/sql/create-tables.sql[create-tables.sql] +
Creating the database tables. +
⇒ link:../../ch04_spring-persistence/src/main/resources/db/sql/insert-data.sql[insert-data.sql] +
Seeding the database table with data.

. Including a new identifier attribute `id` into the `ColoredShape`. +
⇒ link:../../ch04_spring-persistence/src/main/java/bnymellon/training/spring/framework/model/ColoredShape.java[ColoredShape.java] +
Model for the Colored Shape

. Creating an interface to abstract the methods of the *Data Access Object*. Check the
Create-Read-Update-Delete (*CRUD*) operations. +
⇒ link:../../ch04_spring-persistence/src/main/java/bnymellon/training/spring/framework/dao/ColoredShapeDao.java[ColoredShapeDao.java] +
DAO interface to communicate with the database.

NOTE: Using System.out.println(...), is generally a very bad idea, it is only used here to
illustrate the functioning of the persistence layer.

The typical use of such code is in testing, where a real database can be replaced with an embedded
one, to produce a reusable test environment.

=== Persistence with XML Context configuration
This example demonstrates using an XML context for persistence.

. The main class to run: +
⇒ link:../../ch04_spring-persistence/src/main/java/bnymellon/training/spring/framework/Ex01_DB_XMLConfigured.java[Ex01_DB_XMLConfigured.java] +
This class loads the `spring-config.xml` using a `ClassPathXmlApplicationContext`. A
`ColoredShapeDao` is picked from the Spring context and the CRUD calls are made via the DAO.

. The XML-based configuration *spring-config.xml* loads a few beans into the Spring context. +
⇒ link:../../ch04_spring-persistence/src/main/resources/spring-config.xml[spring-config.xml] +
The XML creates a datasource bean, which then invokes the creates database tables and seeds values
from the two SQL files. This is done via `jdbc:scripts`.

. The _Data Access Object_ performs the tasks of operating with the database. The class used for
this example implements the `ColoredShapeDao` interface. +
⇒ link:../../ch04_spring-persistence/src/main/java/bnymellon/training/spring/framework/dao/ColoredShapeDaoImplEx01.java[ColoredShapeDaoImplEx01.java] +
This class is an implementation of the `ColoredShapeDao` interface. All CRUD methods are
implemented. The DAO implementation also defines a `RowMapper`, as a `ColoredShapeMapper`, that
maps a `ResultSet` to a `ColoredShape` Java object. The XML config passes in the `dataSource` as a
*constructor argument*.

The spring-config.xml declares an embedded database as a dataSource. The dataSource is the most
important bean in persistence. A reference of this dataSource is passed to the Data Access
Object (DAO), so the DAO can invoke data operations on the dataSource.

.Output
****
 Running the main method should output
 > INFO: Starting embedded database: url='jdbc:h2:mem:dataSource;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1;DB_CLOSE_ON_EXIT=false', username='sa'

=== Persistence with Java Context configuration
This example demonstrates using an Java context for persistence.

. The main class to run: +
⇒ link:../../ch04_spring-persistence/src/main/java/bnymellon/training/spring/framework/Ex02_DB_JavaConfigured.java[Ex02_DB_JavaConfigured.java] +
This class loads the `@Configuration` via _ComponentScan_ using an
`AnnotationConfigApplicationContext`. A `ColoredShapeDao` is picked from the Spring context, and the
CRUD calls are made via the DAO.

. The Java-based configuration is scanned via the `@ComponentScan`: +
⇒ link:../../ch04_spring-persistence/src/main/java/bnymellon/training/spring/framework/model/DBConfiguration.java[DBConfiguration.java] +
The Java configuration declares an embedded database as a dataSource. The dataSource is an important
bean in persistence. An autowiring of this dataSource to the Data Access Object (DAO), allows
the DAO to invoke data operations on the dataSource.

. The _Data Access Object_ performs the tasks of operating with the database. The class used for
this example implements the `ColoredShapeDao` interface. +
⇒ link:../../ch04_spring-persistence/src/main/java/bnymellon/training/spring/framework/dao/ColoredShapeDaoImplEx02.java[ColoredShapeDaoImplEx02.java] +
This class is an implementation of the `ColoredShapeDao` interface. All CRUD methods are
implemented. The DAO implementation also defines a `RowMapper`, as a `ColoredShapeMapper`, that
maps a `ResultSet` to a `ColoredShape` Java object. An `@Autowired` annotation on the constructor
_injects_ the `dataSource` into the DAO.

The DBConfiguration declares an embedded database as a dataSource. The dataSource is the most
important bean in persistence. An autowiring of this dataSource to the Data Access Object (DAO),
allows the DAO to invoke data operations on the dataSource.
