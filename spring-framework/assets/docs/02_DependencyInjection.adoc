= Dependency Injection in Spring
:toc:
:toclevels: 4

Understanding how Spring "wires" its "beans".

== Spring - Dependency Injection

In Spring, dependencies can be injected by the following popular means:

XML-based container config:: the Java bean is loaded into the spring container registry via a
configuration XML that "describes" the POJO attributes.

Annotation-based container config:: the Java bean is loaded into the spring container registry via
stereotype hints annotated on the POJO with values in an external XML file.

Java-based container configuration:: Configuration is completely moved to Java, no need for XML at
all.

Let us walk through a few examples.

'''

== Java Example without Spring

The previous chapter detailed how Spring loads XML to manage bean configurations. It included a
basic example of Spring using the default constructor to instantiate a bean.

== Using Spring to achieve Dependency Injection (DI)

=== Using XML based Dependency Injection

We will take a look at how a dependency injection can be configured using an XML file.

==== Example 1 - XML injection - constructor with unique parameter types
This example demonstrates a loading of a bean with a default constructor call. No custom values
are set. The XML configuration simply instantiates a bean to be made available to the holder.

1. The Java code to execute +
⇒ link:../../ch02_spring-dependency-injection/src/main/java/bnymellon/training/spring/framework/xml/Ex01_DIThroughConstructorSimple.java[Ex01_DIThroughConstructorSimple.java]. +
This class has a `ClassPathXmlApplicationContext` which reads the XML configuration. The
`ApplicationContext` is the Spring Inversion of Control. The `main` method transfers control of
loading beans to the `ClassPathXmlApplicationContext`, which then loads _beans_ from the XML file.
The XML file provides an injection of a `ColoredShape` _bean_ into a `ColoredShapeHolder` _bean_
via *_Constructor Injection_* based on *determining the types of arguments*.

2. The Java code for the model loaded from the XML file +
⇒ link:../../ch02_spring-dependency-injection/src/main/java/bnymellon/training/spring/framework/model/ColoredShape.java[ColoredShape.java]. +
⇒ link:../../ch02_spring-dependency-injection/src/main/java/bnymellon/training/spring/framework/model/ColoredShapeHolder.java[ColoredShapeHolder.java].

3. Here is the XML configuration for this Spring class +
⇒ link:../../ch02_spring-dependency-injection/src/main/resources/ex01-di-through-constructor-simple.xml[ex01-di-through-constructor-simple.xml].

4. Notice how the two argument constructor from `ColoredShapeHolder` is used to inject the
`ColoredShape` based on *argument types*. The order, in this case, does not matter, since the
types accepted by the constructor are unique.

.Output
****
 Running the main method should output
 > 1 count of colored shape: [ green circle ]
 created with quantity of 1 configured for the bean ColoredShapeHolder.
****

'''

==== Example 2 - XML injection - constructor using named arguments
This example demonstrates a loading of a bean with a constructor call passing arguments. The
arguments represent the parameter names. The XML configuration simply instantiates a bean to be
made available to the holder and sets constructor values based on the names.

1. The Java code to execute +
⇒ link:../../ch02_spring-dependency-injection/src/main/java/bnymellon/training/spring/framework/xml/Ex02_DIThroughConstructorNamed.java[Ex02_DIThroughConstructorNamed.java] +
This class has a `ClassPathXmlApplicationContext` which reads the XML configuration. The
`ApplicationContext` is the Spring Inversion of Control. The `main` method transfers control of
loading beans to the `ClassPathXmlApplicationContext`, which then loads _beans_ from the XML file.
The XML file provides an injection of a `ColoredShape` _bean_ into a `ColoredShapeHolder` _bean_
via *_Constructor Injection_* using *constructor argument names*.

2. Here is the XML configuration for this Spring class +
⇒ link:../../ch02_spring-dependency-injection/src/main/resources/ex02-di-through-constructor-named.xml[ex02-di-through-constructor-named.xml].

3. Notice how the two argument constructor from `ColoredShapeHolder` is used to inject the
`ColoredShape` based on *argument names*. The order, in this case, does not matter, since the
argument names are unique.

.Output
****
 Running the main method should output
 > 5 count of colored shape: [ red rectangle ]
 created with quantity of 5 configured for the bean ColoredShapeHolder.
****

'''

==== Example 3 - XML injection - constructor using argument index
This example demonstrates a loading of a bean with a constructor call passing arguments. The
arguments represent the parameter indices. The XML configuration simply instantiates a
bean to be made available to the holder.

1. The Java code to execute +
⇒ link:../../ch02_spring-dependency-injection/src/main/java/bnymellon/training/spring/framework/xml/Ex03_DIThroughConstructorIndex.java[Ex03_DIThroughConstructorIndex.java] +
This class has a `ClassPathXmlApplicationContext` which reads the XML configuration. The
`ApplicationContext` is the Spring Inversion of Control. The `main` method transfers control of
loading beans to the `ClassPathXmlApplicationContext`, which then loads _beans_ from the XML file.
The XML file provides an injection of a `ColoredShape` _bean_ into a `ColoredShapeHolder` _bean_
via *_Constructor Injection_* using *constructor argument indices*.

2. Here is the XML configuration for this Spring class +
⇒ link:../../ch02_spring-dependency-injection/src/main/resources/ex03-di-through-constructor-index.xml[ex03-di-through-constructor-index.xml].

3. Notice how the two argument constructor from `ColoredShapeHolder` is used to inject the
`ColoredShape` based on *argument indices*. The order, in this case, does not matter, since the
argument indices are well-defined.

.Output
****
 Running the main method should output
 > 7 count of colored shape: [ cyan cylinder ]
 created with quantity of 7 configured for the bean ColoredShapeHolder.
****

'''

==== Example 4 - XML injection - calling the setter to set property values
This example demonstrates a loading of a bean with setter calls passing values. The property
includes a named attribute of each bean property. The XML configuration simply instantiates a bean
to be made available to the holder.

1. The Java code to execute +
⇒ link:../../ch02_spring-dependency-injection/src/main/java/bnymellon/training/spring/framework/xml/Ex04_DIThroughSetters.java[Ex04_DIThroughSetters.java] +
This class has a `ClassPathXmlApplicationContext` which reads the XML configuration. The
`ApplicationContext` is the Spring Inversion of Control. The `main` method transfers control of
loading beans to the `ClassPathXmlApplicationContext`, which then loads _beans_ from the XML file.
The XML file provides an injection of a `ColoredShape` _bean_ into a `ColoredShapeHolder` _bean_
via *_Setter Injection_* using *setters*.

2. Here is the XML configuration for this Spring class +
⇒ link:../../ch02_spring-dependency-injection/src/main/resources/ex04-di-through-setters.xml[ex04-di-through-setters.xml].

3. Notice how the bean is declared with property values being set in both `ColoredShape` which is
then is used to inject the property in `ColoredShapeHolder` based on *property setters*. The order
of setting properties, does not matter, since the properties can be set in any order.

.Output
****
 Running the main method should output
 > 3 count of colored shape: [ black box ]
 created with quantity of 3 configured for the bean ColoredShapeHolder.
****

=== Using Annotation based Dependency Injection

The next few examples demonstrate how Java annotations can be used to inject dependencies.

==== Example 5 - Annotation injection - calling the setter to set property values
This example demonstrates a loading of a bean with setter annotations to wire. The property
includes a named attribute of each bean property. The XML configuration simply instantiates a bean
to be made available to the holder. The ColoredShape is NOT passed to the ColoredShapeHolder.

1. The Java code to execute +
⇒ link:../../ch02_spring-dependency-injection/src/main/java/bnymellon/training/spring/framework/annotation/Ex05_DIThroughAnnotationSetters.java[Ex05_DIThroughAnnotationSetters.java] +
This class loads beans via an XML and then invokes a `SetterAnnotatedColoredShapeHolder`.

2. Here is the XML configuration for this Spring class +
⇒ link:../../ch02_spring-dependency-injection/src/main/resources/ex05-di-through-annotation-setters.xml[ex05-di-through-annotation-setters.xml] +
The XML only declares two beans, but *does nothing to inject*. Also notice a special instruction
to the `beans` schema, and the addition of a `<context:annotation-config/>` excerpt. The addition
of the schemas and the declaration of this excerpt are important to process annotations.

3. The Java Code that injects the dependency +
⇒ link:../../ch02_spring-dependency-injection/src/main/java/bnymellon/training/spring/framework/model/SetterAnnotatedColoredShapeHolder.java[SetterAnnotatedColoredShapeHolder.java] +
This class has an `@Autowired` annotation for the `setColoredShape()`. The XML file defines the
beans that are loaded via the `ClassPathXmlApplicationContext`. This part creates a registry of
beans. The `SetterAnnotatedColoredShapeHolder` has the `@Autowired` annotation on the setter,
which queries the registry to *_find a matching bean_* to set the `ColoredShape`.

.Output
****
 Running the main method should output
 > 11 count of colored shape: [ red rhombus ]
 created with quantity of 11 configured for the bean ColoredShapeHolder.
****

'''

==== Example 6 - Annotation injection - calling the constructor to inject values
This example demonstrates a loading of a bean with constructor annotations to wire. The property
includes a named attribute of each bean property. The XML configuration simply instantiates a bean
to be made available to the holder. The ColoredShape is NOT passed to the ColoredShapeHolder.

1. The Java code to execute +
⇒ link:../../ch02_spring-dependency-injection/src/main/java/bnymellon/training/spring/framework/annotation/Ex06_DIThroughAnnotationConstructor.java[Ex06_DIThroughAnnotationConstructor.java] +
This class loads beans via an XML and then invokes a `ConstructorAnnotatedColoredShapeHolder`.

2. Here is the XML configuration for this Spring class +
⇒ link:../../ch02_spring-dependency-injection/src/main/resources/ex06-di-through-annotation-constructor.xml[ex06-di-through-annotation-constructor.xml] +
The XML only declares two beans, but *does nothing to inject*. Also notice a special instruction
to the `beans` schema, and the addition of a `<context:annotation-config/>` excerpt. The addition
of the schemas and the declaration of this excerpt are important to process annotations.

3. The Java Code that injects the dependency +
⇒ link:../../ch02_spring-dependency-injection/src/main/java/bnymellon/training/spring/framework/model/ConstructorAnnotatedColoredShapeHolder.java[ConstructorAnnotatedColoredShapeHolder.java] +
This class has an `@Autowired` annotation for the constructor. The XML file defines the beans that
are loaded via the `ClassPathXmlApplicationContext`. This part creates a registry of beans. The
`ConstructorAnnotatedColoredShapeHolder` has the `@Autowired` annotation on the constructor, which
queries the registry to *_find a matching bean_* to set the `ColoredShape`.

.Output
****
 Running the main method should output
 > 2 count of colored shape: [ orange oval ]
 created with quantity of 2 configured for the bean ColoredShapeHolder.
****

'''

==== Example 7 - Annotation injection - calling the constructor to inject values, with a Qualifier
This example demonstrates a loading of a bean with constructor annotations to wire. The property
includes a named attribute of each bean property. The XML configuration simply instantiates a bean
to be made available to the holder and includes a qualifier. The ColoredShape is NOT passed to
the ColoredShapeHolder.

1. The Java code to execute +
⇒ link:../../ch02_spring-dependency-injection/src/main/java/bnymellon/training/spring/framework/annotation/Ex07_DIThroughAnnotationWithQualifiers.java[Ex07_DIThroughAnnotationWithQualifiers.java] +
This class loads beans via an XML and then invokes a `ConstructorAnnotatedQualifiedColoredShapeHolder`.

2. Here is the XML configuration for this Spring class +
⇒ link:../../ch02_spring-dependency-injection/src/main/resources/ex07-di-through-annotation-with-qualifiers.xml[ex07-di-through-annotation-with-qualifiers.xml] +
The XML only declares three beans, but *does nothing to inject*. There are two `ColoredShape`
beans, which will lead to a _confusion_ about which bean to load. Notice the new qualifier
definition for both `ColoredShape` beans. Also notice a special instruction to the `beans` schema,
and the addition of a `<context:annotation-config/>` excerpt. The addition of the schemas and the
declaration of this excerpt are important to process annotations.

3. The Java Code that injects the dependency +
⇒ link:../../ch02_spring-dependency-injection/src/main/java/bnymellon/training/spring/framework/model/ConstructorAnnotatedQualifiedColoredShapeHolder.java[ConstructorAnnotatedQualifiedColoredShapeHolder.java] +
This class has an `@Autowired` annotation for the constructor. The Constructor parameter also has
an annotation of a `Qualifier` which specifies that the bean to load uses the *`thePinkPolygon`*
bean, and *_not the aColoredShape_*. The XML file defines the beans that are loaded via the
`ClassPathXmlApplicationContext`. This part creates a registry of beans. The
`ConstructorAnnotatedColoredShapeHolder` has the `@Autowired` annotation on the constructor,
which queries the registry to *_find a matching bean_* to set the `ColoredShape`.

.Output
****
 Running the main method should output
 > 4 count of colored shape: [ pink polygon ]
 created with quantity of 4 configured for the bean ColoredShapeHolder.

=== Using Java based Dependency Injection

The next few examples demonstrate how Java annotations, _without any XML_, can be used to inject dependencies.

==== Example 8 - Java-only injection - autowiring with a Component Scan
This example demonstrates a loading of a bean with wiring via component scans. The annotation on
the main class allows scanning of all classes in the base package specified in the parameter.
Special annotations that define the behaviour of a class. Spring framework treats such annotated
classes as first class beans. Any classes marked with a stereotype indicates that the class being a
bean are picked into the context.

1. The Java code to execute +
⇒ link:../../ch02_spring-dependency-injection/src/main/java/bnymellon/training/spring/framework/java/Ex08_DIThroughJava.java[Ex08_DIThroughJava.java] +
This class has an annotation to `@ComponentScan` all Spring-annotated classes in the
`bnymellon.training.spring.framework.model` package. This is the Java equivalent of creating bean
definitions in XML. Notice how the @ComponentScan points to a base package to scan, Spring picks up
all classes marked as a `@Component` from the base package. Notice the use of an
`AnnotationConfigApplicationContext` to load the context beans via annotations. Since we do not
pass any classes, package or configuration location, the annotation context need to be first
registered and then refreshed to ensure scanning and subsequent loading of all necessary
Spring-related beans.

2. A few model classes are created that contain the `@Component` annotation informing Spring to
load them up as beans.
⇒ link:../../ch02_spring-dependency-injection/src/main/java/bnymellon/training/spring/framework/model/BlackBox.java[BlackBox.java].
⇒ link:../../ch02_spring-dependency-injection/src/main/java/bnymellon/training/spring/framework/model/OrangeOval.java[OrangeOval.java]. +
Notice there are other `ColoredShape` classes that are *NOT* loaded into the Spring context, since
they are not marked with the `@Component` annotation. Examples include `CyanCylinder` and
`RedRectangle`.

3. The Java code that autowires +
⇒ link:../../ch02_spring-dependency-injection/src/main/java/bnymellon/training/spring/framework/model/AutowiredColoredShapeHolder.java[AutowiredColoredShapeHolder.java] +
This class autowires the constructor to look for an instance of `OrangeOval` in the context.
The AutowiredColoredShapeHolder itself picks up the OrangeOval loaded during the component scan.
Since only one instance is declared, it is found and auto-wired in.

.Output
****
 Running the main method should output
 > 1 count of colored shape: [ orange oval ]
 created with quantity of 2 configured for the bean ColoredShapeHolder.
****

'''

==== Example 9 - Java-only injection - autowiring with a @Configuration bean
This example demonstrates a loading of a bean with wiring configured in a Java object. The
annotation on the main class allows scanning of all classes in the base package specified in
the parameter. Any class marked with @Configuration annotation (this annotation is also called a
stereotype), indicate that it replaces XML configurations previously discussed.

1. The Java code to execute +
⇒ link:../../ch02_spring-dependency-injection/src/main/java/bnymellon/training/spring/framework/java/Ex09_DIThroughJavaConfiguration.java[Ex09_DIThroughJavaConfiguration.java] +
This class uses the same `AnnotationConfigApplicationContext` as used in the previous example.
Since the configuration points to a specific Java class, it can skip the need to register and
refresh. The `ColoredShapeHolder` instance is retrieved by name from the context.

2. The Java code that provides the configurations +
⇒ link:../../ch02_spring-dependency-injection/src/main/java/bnymellon/training/spring/framework/model/DIConfiguration.java[DIConfiguration.java] +
This class provides the beans (with their names) of *tealtrapezoid*, *tealTrapezoidHolder* and
*redRectangleHolder* to be loaded into the Spring context.

.Output
****
 Running the main method should output
 > 10 count of colored shape: [ teal trapezoid ]
