= Spring Boot - Profiles and Configuration
:toc:
:toclevels: 4

Configure and customize Spring Boot applications.

== Activating Profiles
Spring Boot allows activation of profiles. When no specific profile is set to be active, Spring Boot
selects what is known as `default` profile.

Profiles in Spring Boot can be activated in several ways:

Command Line:: Add a `-Dspring.profile.active=<PROFILE_NAME>` when running the app
Environment Variable:: Set and export an environment variable +
`spring_profiles_active = <PROFILE_NAME>`
System Property:: Set a SystemProperty +
`System.setProperty("spring.profiles.active", "<PROFILE_NAME>")`
ConfigurableEnvironment:: Invoke a `setActiveProfiles(<PROFILE_NAME>)` on the `@Autowired` instance of the
`ConfigurableEnvironment`

'''

== Spring External Configuration

Spring provides multiple ways to configure portions of the application. As of *Spring Boot v2.4.2*,
there are 14 different ways to configure a Spring Boot application, with a clear hierarchy of how
each configuration overrides values set in previous configuration formats.

A lot more is covered at the
link:https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.4.2/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-external-config[*Spring Boot Reference - External Configuration*].

In the Todo examples only the YAML variants are covered.

. Default application.yaml +
⇒ link:../../todo/src/main/resources/application.yaml[application.yaml]
.. The default yaml configuration file contains a portion separated by a ---. These are profile
sections.
.. The spring: config: activate: on-profile determined when the section is activated.
.. A value for `todo.title` is set when the profile is activated.

. Application yaml for development environment +
⇒ link:../../todo/src/main/resources/application-development.yaml[application-development.yaml]
.. Loaded when the active profiles includes *development*.
.. A value for `todo.descriptiveText` is set when the *development* profile is activated.

. Application yaml for production environment +
⇒ link:../../todo/src/main/resources/application-production.yaml[application-production.yaml]
.. Loaded when the active profiles includes *production*.
.. A value for `todo.descriptiveText` is set when the *production* profile is activated.

. Loading the custom configurations into the context +
⇒ link:../../todo/src/main/java/bnymellon/training/spring/boot/todo/config/ProfileConfigurationProperties.java[ProfileConfigurationProperties.java] +
.. The `@ConfigurationProperties` sets the prefix for the properties handled by this class.
.. The `title` and `descriptiveText` are loaded into the instance, which is also injected into
the context, thanks to the `@Component` annotation.

The content in `application.yaml` is always loaded. The Spring active profile determines if the
suffixed files also get loaded.

For instance, setting the active profile to *production*, will cause the
`application-production.yaml` to be loaded.

'''

== Spring Profiles

Spring Profiles set on beans and configurations allow for selective loading. This is set with a
`@Profile` annotation on a bean or configuration. When a Spring Profile is activated, the bean or
configuration that is marked by the profile is activated and added to the context.

While the actual Swagger documentation context is not yet covered, as a preview, let us examine the
usage of profiles in the Swagger configuration.

. Default Swagger configuration +
⇒ link:../../todo/src/main/java/bnymellon/training/spring/boot/todo/config/TodoDefaultServiceSwaggerConfig.java[TodoDefaultServiceSwaggerConfig.java] +
.. This configuration is loaded when no profile is specifically made active.
.. The `@Profile` annotation at the class specifies that this is activated for the *default* profile.

. Development Swagger configuration +
⇒ link:../../todo/src/main/java/bnymellon/training/spring/boot/todo/config/TodoDevelopmentServiceSwaggerConfig.java[TodoDevelopmentServiceSwaggerConfig.java] +
.. This configuration is loaded when the *development* profile is made active (and the *default*
profile is inactive).
.. The `@Profile` annotation at the class specifies that this is activated for the *development*
profile and not when the *default* active.
.. This configuration uses the `@Autowired` `ProfileConfigurationProperties` instance.

. Production Swagger configuration +
⇒ link:../../todo/src/main/java/bnymellon/training/spring/boot/todo/config/TodoProductionServiceSwaggerConfig.java[TodoProductionServiceSwaggerConfig.java] +
.. This configuration is loaded when the *production* profile is made active (and the *default*
profile is inactive).
.. The `@Profile` annotation at the class specifies that this is activated for the *production*
profile and not when the *default* active.
.. This configuration uses the `@Autowired` `ProfileConfigurationProperties` instance.

== Exercise Lab

image:../../../assets/images/labtime.png[Lab, align="center"]

. Update the application.yaml to include an activation for development and production.
.. Set a lab:swaggerTitle: for development and for production.
. Create yaml files for environments:
.. *development* and *production*.
.. set the value lab:description to match the environment.
. Create empty Swagger configurations with the right profiles.
