Building the controller layer - documentation and response handling

== Swagger documentation
The controller layer consists of an interface and an implementation of the interface. The
implementation focuses on the functional controller logic while the interface serves as the
contract for the API to the consumers of the service.

The ideal location for the documentation thus is the interface.

Interface +
⇒ link:../../todo/src/main/java/bnymellon/training/spring/boot/todo/controller/TodoAPIContract.java[TodoAPIContract.java]

Model +
⇒ link:../../todo/src/main/java/bnymellon/training/spring/boot/todo/model/Todo.java[Todo.java]

Below is a list of annotations used to document the API.

`@Api`:: Marks the class as a Swagger resource. Such tags logically group operations when the
documentation is generated.

`@ApiOperation`:: Describes an API operation. The value shows as the summary of the operation
while the notes show as the detailed description.

`@ApiResponses`:: A wrapper to allow a list of multiple response objects, listing the HTTP code,
message and the Java class that maps to the response payload.

`@ApiParam`:: Provides meta-data for the operation parameters.

`@ApiModelProperty`:: Adds and manipulates data of a model property.

== Swagger configuration

The swagger annotations on the classes will need to be picked up, parsed and converted into a
meaningful document. This is done via a @Configuration class that Spring Boot loads on startup.

As covered in the previous chapter, Swagger configurations rely on Profiles.

. Default Swagger Configuration
⇒ link:../../todo/src/main/java/bnymellon/training/spring/boot/todo/config/TodoDefaultServiceSwaggerConfig.java[TodoDefaultServiceSwaggerConfig.java]

. Development Swagger Configuration
⇒ link:../../todo/src/main/java/bnymellon/training/spring/boot/todo/config/TodoDevelopmentServiceSwaggerConfig.java[TodoDevelopmentServiceSwaggerConfig.java]

. Production Swagger Configuration
⇒ link:../../todo/src/main/java/bnymellon/training/spring/boot/todo/config/TodoProductionServiceSwaggerConfig.java[TodoProductionServiceSwaggerConfig.java]

`@EnableSwagger2`:: Indicates that Swagger support should be enabled. Only functional if included
in a class also marked as a @Configuration.

`Docket`:: A Documentation plugin that serves as an entry point into the spring framework.
A Docket is used to configure the paths to search for swagger annotations, any filters, and
an ApiInfo instance.

`ApiInfo`:: A swagger meta-data holder for the documentation. Attributes include a title,
description, terms of service, a license and a version.

== Response Handling

With valid operations and parameters, under normal circumstances, the controller communicates
with the traversal layers to complete the round-trip of the operation. Once it receives a response
back from the service layer, the controller pushes the result into the response object along with
some metadata, to be transmitted back to the API invoker.

In case of erroneous inputs or adverse circumstances, one of the layers may throw exceptions.
Such exceptions should be converted into known exceptions. Either:

* either handle the Exception in the controller to generate a meaningful response.
* or catch and convert the exception into a known exception and handle the known exception in
the controller.

In the todo-service, the exceptions are handled in the controller, using an `@ExceptionHandler`.
The handler specifies the exception(s) being handled.

Appropriate HTTP response codes and failure messages are included in the response, so the
invoking consumer of the service gets a detailed information. The HTTP error code serves as an
important means to automate processing of responses for the service consumer.
