= Spring Boot - Testing the REST API
:toc:
:toclevels: 6

Building the REST test layer, using POSTMAN and viewing the swagger documentation

== Testing the REST operations

REST operations can be tested with several third party libraries. The examples use
Spring's `MockMvc` as a framework of choice for testing the RESTful layer.

MockMvc works by launching the application in a simulated server.

. Spring Boot Web Application Test +
â‡’ link:../../todo/src/test/java/bnymellon/training/spring/boot/todo/controller/TodoAPIContractRestTest.java[TodoAPIContractRestTest.java]
.. The test is still launched by extending JUnit using an `@ExtendWith` annotation and supplying a
`SpringExtension.class`.
.. The second class annotation declares that this test is a `@WebMvcTest`. Using this annotation
prevents most auto-configurations, and simply loads configurations limited to the
Model-View-Controller (MVC) layer, such as Controllers and not any `@Service`, `@Repository` or
even `@Component` annotations.

. A `MockMvc` is auto-wired from the Spring Context.

. The `TodoService` is marked as a `@MockBean`.

. The `setUp()` method runs before each test method and sets up a few `Todo` instances.

. Each test method:
.. sets up an appropriate Service mock for the action being tested
.. creates a `RequestBuilder` with or without a payload
.. fetches the `MvcResult` by ``perform``ing the request
.. extracts the JSON string from the response and asserts specific values in the extracted JSON

'''

== Launch the application

Testing the application manually, requires launching the application. The application can be
launched from: either the IDE (run the TodoApplication).

or build the spring uber jar and run the command from: +
`java -jar todo-1.0.0.jar` +
from the target directory.

The application launches on port 8080 by default, as shown in the logs from the launch.


=== Manual testing with tools

==== Using Insomnia or Postman

The application launches on port 8080 by default, as shown in the logs from the launch.

===== Steps to test

. Launch Insomnia or Postman.
. Run any of the below tests as needed.
