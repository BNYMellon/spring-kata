= Spring Boot - The Controller Layer

Building the controller layer and its unit tests

== The Responses

Each incoming request should have an appropriate response, be it a data response or an error
response.

The response package has several java classes that make up various data and error
responses.

. A Status object to provide status information (request success, code and a description) +
⇒ link:../../todo/src/main/java/bnymellon/training/spring/boot/todo/model/response/Status.java[Status.java]

. A Metadata object to provide request and response metadata +
⇒ link:../../todo/src/main/java/bnymellon/training/spring/boot/todo/model/response/Metadata.java[Metadata.java]

. An Issue object to include exception details issue code and description +
⇒ link:../../todo/src/main/java/bnymellon/training/spring/boot/todo/model/response/Issue.java[Issue.java]

. A TodoResponse interface is a marker interface for several other responses +
⇒ link:../../todo/src/main/java/bnymellon/training/spring/boot/todo/model/response/TodoResponse.java[TodoResponse.java]
.. A *marker* (or *tagging*) interface is one that has no actual methods. The sole pupose is to act as a hierarchical ancestor for a class that implements such an interface.

. A TodoSuccessResponse object that includes a metadata and a single todo object +
⇒ link:../../todo/src/main/java/bnymellon/training/spring/boot/todo/model/response/TodoSuccessResponse.java[TodoSuccessResponse.java]

. A TodoErrorResponse object that includes a metadata and a list of issues associated +
⇒ link:../../todo/src/main/java/bnymellon/training/spring/boot/todo/model/response/TodoErrorResponse.java[TodoErrorResponse.java]

. A TodoCollectionResponse object that includes a metadata and a list of todo objects +
⇒ link:../../todo/src/main/java/bnymellon/training/spring/boot/todo/model/response/TodoCollectionResponse.java[TodoCollectionResponse.java]

'''

== The Responses unit tests
As with the model, the responses have a few attributes, the tests focus on the `equals`, `hashCode`
and the `toString` methods.

. StatusTest +
⇒ link:../../todo/src/test/java/bnymellon/training/spring/boot/todo/model/response/StatusTest.java[StatusTest.java]

. MetadataTest +
⇒ link:../../todo/src/test/java/bnymellon/training/spring/boot/todo/model/response/MetadataTest.java[MetadataTest.java]

. IssueTest  +
⇒ link:../../todo/src/test/java/bnymellon/training/spring/boot/todo/model/response/IssueTest.java[IssueTest.java]

. TodoSuccessResponseTest +
⇒ link:../../todo/src/test/java/bnymellon/training/spring/boot/todo/model/response/TodoSuccessResponseTest.java[TodoSuccessResponseTest.java]

. TodoErrorResponseTest  +
⇒ link:../../todo/src/test/java/bnymellon/training/spring/boot/todo/model/response/TodoErrorResponseTest.java[TodoErrorResponseTest.java]

. TodoCollectionResponseTest +
⇒ link:../../todo/src/test/java/bnymellon/training/spring/boot/todo/model/response/TodoCollectionResponseTest.java[TodoCollectionResponseTest.java]

'''

== The Controller Layer
The controller layer breaks down the incoming HTTP request and makes the necessary calls to the
service layers, acts as a layer marshalling and unmarshalling the request/response objects
from/to JSON.

The controller layer also pads the relevant metadata as a part of building out a response.

The controller package has an interface and an implementation. The interface is covered in more
detail in a subsequent chapter.

. Controller Interface +
⇒ link:../../todo/src/main/java/bnymellon/training/spring/boot/todo/controller/TodoAPIContract.java[TodoAPIContract.java]
.. There are a lot of annotations on each interface method, but in essence, there are six declared
methods, all of which, return a `ResponseEntity<TodoResponse>`.

. ControllerImplementation +
⇒ link:../../todo/src/main/java/bnymellon/training/spring/boot/todo/controller/TodoAPIContractImpl.java[TodoAPIContractImpl.java]
.. The controller implementation is marked with a `@RestController` stereotype.
.. The class has a `@RequestMapping` annotation which provides a context path for the web URLs.
.. The `constructor` autowires a `TodoService` interface which is made available via a Spring
context.
.. The Controller Implementation validates the request body upon invocation and also creates the
response body to return the desired content.
.. The metadata information is baked into the responses built out from the service calls.

NOTE: Ignore the annotations surrounding the methods, these will be discussed later.

'''

== The Controller unit test
The controller is tested with @SpringBootTest.

. Test extending the abstract test setup +
⇒ link:../../todo/src/test/java/bnymellon/training/spring/boot/todo/controller/TodoAPIContractTest.java[TodoAPIContractTest.java]
.. This test extends from the *abstract* test class which adds a *mock* implementation of the
`TodoService` with a `@MockBean` annotation.
.. The `@MockBean` is a mockito utility present in the `spring-boot-test.jar` that injects a bean
into the Spring context after adding some mock responses.
.. The calls to the `TodoContractImpl` pass a `null` for a *request*. This test is simply unit
testing all operations, so no JSON is sent with the request and no JSON is expected as a response.

. Abstract mock setup +
⇒ link:../../todo/src/test/java/bnymellon/training/spring/boot/todo/AbstractTodoMockSetupTest.java[AbstractTodoMockSetupTest.java]
.. Abstract mock class (re-used in other tests)

== Exercise Lab

image:../../../assets/images/labtime.png[Lab, align="center"]

. Create the lab responses and controller layers and appropriate unit tests.
.. Cover the basic HTTP Error code responses shown in the sample.
. The following controller APIs should be created:
.. Find By OwnerLastName, should return a list.
.. Find By Active = True, should return a list.
.. Find By Active = True And Owner Last Name, should return a list.
.. Find By First Name matching part of the string, should return an optional list.
