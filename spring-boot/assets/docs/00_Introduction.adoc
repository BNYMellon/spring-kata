Spring App Development Made Easy

== Why Spring Boot exists

Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that
you can “just run”.

* Most Spring Boot applications need very little Spring configuration.

* No code generation and no requirement for XML configuration.

* Bootstraps the wiring of the application so developer can focus on business logic.

== About Spring Boot

=== Spring Boot - Components

Spring Boot is typically composed of:

Spring Boot Auto-Configure:: a module to auto-configure a wide range of Spring projects. It detects
the availability of certain frameworks (Spring Batch, Spring Data JPA, Hibernate, JDBC).
When a framework library is detected, Spring Boot attempts to auto-configure the found framework
with some sensible defaults.

Spring Boot CLI:: command line interface to start/stop Spring Boot applications.

Spring Boot Starters:: quick start projects to include as a dependency in the build file. Starter
packs have the necessary dependencies for that type of application.

Spring Cloud:: consist of starter packs and modules that help with microservices, cloud native
applications and metrics.

'''

=== Spring Boot - Philosophy

Spring Boot is an opinionated framework that works with a convention-over-configuration
approach. Spring Boot produces an executable binary **J**ava **AR**chive (jar file) that is quite
different in structure and content, when compared to normal library jar files.

Spring boot includes a maven plugin that produces what is referred to as an *uber jar*.
The uber jar is a jar file that not only bundles the compiled java classes but also all
dependencies required to run the application.

==== "Make JAR Not WAR"

Contrary to popular historical choices, Spring boot applications are better produced as a jar
file rather than a war file.

===== .war files
A war (**W**eb **AR**chive) file has historically been the typical
deployable artifact for web applications. The WAR file typically was copied into the a *web server*
and would get expanded in the web server location. To launch an WAR file, the containing
*web server* would need to be launched*.

===== Spring Boot Uber Jar
A Spring Boot *Uber* JAR (**J**ava **AR**chive) file is Spring Boot's response to avoiding the
creation of a .war file. The Spring Boot uber jar is different from a typical library jar file. This
*uber jar* contains a Spring Boot launcher, an embedded *web server* and a packaging of all
dependencies needed by the application logic.

'''

=== Spring Boot - How it works

Building a Spring Boot application results in the creation of an *uber jar*. This uber jar has a
few elements. Important to note:

==== What is in a built uber jar

|____org.springframework.boot.loader.*  <----- The Spring Boot Loader classes
|
|
|____BOOT-INF
| |____classes
| | |____*.class, resource files        <----- The application classes and resources

| |____lib
|   |____*.jar                          <----- Dependencies for the current Spring Boot App

==== Explanation of uber jar contents

Boot Loader classes:: packaged under *`org.springframework.boot.loader`*, these classes act as a
launcher for the Spring Boot application.

Manifest instructions:: located at the *`META-INF/MANIFEST.MF`*, this file contains details such as
the version of Spring Boot used to build this jar, the main class to run, location of the
dependency libraries (`BOOT-INF/lib`, by default) and the location of the classes and resources
for the application (`BOOT-INF/classes`, by default).

Application classes and resources:: default location is under *`BOOT-INF/classes`*, these classes
and resources hold the compiled logic and configurations for the application.

Application dependency libraries:: default location is under *`BOOT-INF/lib`*, the directory
structure contains all dependency libraries required to launch and execute the Spring Boot App.
