== Overview of the lab domain

The lab will focus on building an account CRUD service for a user.

The account contains:

* accountId (`String`)
* balance (`Double`)
* ownerFirstName (`String`)
* ownerLastName (`String`)
* activeFlag(`Boolean`).

As the course progresses, each lab will aim at creating an outcome, parallel to, the discussed example in this lab account-service.

. Use one of the earlier mentioned ways to create a Spring Boot project.
. Use the settings:
.. Project: *Maven Project*
.. Language: *Java*
.. Spring Boot: *2.4.3* _(or any version in the 2.4 series, as long it is not a SNAPSHOT)_
. Project Metadata:
.. Group: *`none.training.spring.boot`*
.. Artifact: *`lab`*
.. Name: *`lab`*
.. Description: *Lab for Spring Boot 2.x*
.. Package name: *`none.training.spring.boot.lab`*
.. Packaging: *Jar*
.. Java: *11*
. Dependencies (type one at a time, Save, click the button to add the next)
.. Spring Web (Web)
.. Validation (I/O)
.. Spring Data JPA (SQL)
. Download the zip file and extract the contents to the *projects* directory.
. For the lab, we will ignore the mvnw and mvnw.cmd files (feel free to delete).
. Update the lab `pom.xml` to include the dependencies (copy from the *todo* POM):
.. Log4j2 Starter
.. Libraries, Jackson and Swagger
.. Testing
. Save the POM, run a maven clean command (command prompt or within the IDE) +
`mvn clean`

=== Confused about creating the project?

Use this link:
link:https://start.spring.io/#!type=maven-project&language=java&platformVersion=2.4.3.RELEASE&packaging=jar&jvmVersion=11&groupId=none.training.spring.boot&artifactId=lab&name=lab&description=Lab%20for%20Spring%20Boot%202.x&packageName=none.training.spring.boot.lab&dependencies=web,data-jpa,validation[Spring Boot Project Creator] to download the starter project, then follow from Step 5 above.
