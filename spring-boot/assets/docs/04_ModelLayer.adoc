= Spring Boot - The Model Layer

Building the model and its unit tests

== The Model Layer
The model consists of only one entity that is managed by the service. +
⇒ link:../../todo/src/main/java/bnymellon/training/spring/boot/todo/model/Todo.java[Todo.java] +

. Mark the object as an JPA entity +
.. Look for the `@Entity` above the class declaration.

. Add the persistence annotations +
.. The `@Table` annotation provides a database table name that corresponds to the `Todo` entity.
.. The `@Id` annotation marks the `id` field as a row identifier primary key. +
.. The `@GeneratedValue` annotation implies that the value is generated by the database. +
.. The `@Column` annotation provides the column name for the field. The column name can be different
from the field name as shown in case of the `activeFlag` field. The column name in the database table
can be different from the field name.

. Setup the JSON properties for the model +
.. The `@JsonInclude` annotation provides hints about what content to serialize. In the `Todo` example,
all *non-null* values are serialized. +
.. The `@JsonPropertyOrder` is merely a suggestion (and may not be honored) about how to order the
attributes in documentation and for formatting the field ordering in a JSON output.

. Setup the documentation for the model +
.. The `@ApiModelProperty` is for Swagger documentation and is _covered later_.
.. The `@JsonPropertyDescription` is for describing the JSON element in a JSON schema.

'''

== The Model unit test
The model is simply a few attributes, the test focuses on the equals, hashCode and the toString. +
⇒ link:../../todo/src/test/java/bnymellon/training/spring/boot/todo/model/TodoTest.java[TodoTest.java]

. There are four `Todo` instances in the test.
. Two instances: `todo1` and `todo2` have the same content while two other instances `emptyTodo1`
and `emptyTodo2` are empty.
. The aim of this test is to ensure code coverage of all methods other
than the getters and setters.

'''

== Exercise Lab

image:../../../assets/images/labtime.png[Lab, align="center"]

. Create an Account object in the none.training.spring.boot.lab package and create its unit test.

. The account contains the following fields:
.. accountId (String),
.. balance (Double),
.. ownerFirstName (String) ,
.. ownerLastName (String) and
.. activeFlag (Boolean).
